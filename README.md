# Angular Address Tracker Web App

This super creepy Angular web app project is an Address Tracker you can use to keep track of the locations of your friends. This app was repurposed from a moch app that would allow superheroes to keep track of supervillains, but I remade it to be something you can use in real life, albeit very weird. The app utilizes a Leaflet module map to display the locations of your list of friends. The list is normally held in a database but will save these results as the API key has been removed. Each friend held in the list has a profile with additional information entered by the user. The locations of these users are tracked through coordinates and can only exist within the lower mainland of BC.
