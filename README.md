# Angular Address Tracker Web App

This super creepy web app project is a Address Tracker you can use to keep track of the locations of your frineds. This app was repurposed from a moch app that would allow super heros to keep track of super villains, but I remade it to be something you can use in real life, albeit very weird. The app utilizes a Leaflet module map to display the loctions of your list of freinds. The list is nomrally held in a databse, but will save these results as the API key has been removed. Each freind held in the list has a profile with additional information entered by the user. The locations of these users are tracked thourgh cooridinates and can only exist within the lower mainland of BC.
